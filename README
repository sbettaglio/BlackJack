Create a single-player blackjack game that plays against the house, i.e., a
human player and computer dealer. You are free to create the user interface
however you want, but keep it simple for Explorer Mode.

Explorer Mode
General Rules:

  [x] The game should be played with a standard deck of playing cards (52).

  [x] The house should be dealt two cards, hidden from the player until the
  house reveals its hand.

  [x] The player should be dealt two cards, visible to the player.

  [x] The player should have a chance to hit (i.e. be dealt another card) until
  they decide to stop or they bust (i.e. their total is over 21). At which
  point they lose regardless of the dealer's hand.

  [] When the player stands, the house reveals its hand and hits (i.e. draw
  cards) until they have 17 or more.

  [] If dealer goes over 21 the dealer loses.

  [x] The player should have two choices: "Hit" and "Stand."

  [x] Consider Aces to be worth 11, never 1.

  [] The app should display the winner. For this mode, the winner is who is
  closer to a blackjack (21) without going over.

  [] There should be an option to play again; this should reset the hands and
  reshuffle the deck.

Adventure Mode

  [] Reveal one of the house's cards to the player when cards dealt.

  [] Consider aces be worth one or eleven.
  
  [] Allow the player to  "Split".
  
  [] Improve the win requirements. From Wikipedia:
    Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not
    busting and having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the
    dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total
    (not counting blackjacks), this is called a "push," and the player typically
    does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins.

Epic Mode

 [] Add a betting system that carries between rounds.
 
 [] Allow the player to "Double down" or "Surrender."
 
 [] Add more players.
